            <p>My 2019 Chrysler 300 Limited was regretfully flooded on the carpets. As a result, I could not operate the driver's seat that became stuck in the full-forward position. Little children could not fit behind the wheel!!  Mike came and dismantled the electrical power seat and was able to manually crank the stuck seat back and disable the power system to the sear which enabled me to drive the vehicle to get service which dried my capreting. Mike is honest and VERY reasonably priced - without him, my vehicle would have been towed at quite a price!  Don't be foolish - call Mike for all your car repair needs! You likely will wonder why you bring your car to a shop when Mike brings the shop to you!</p>

            <p>If you are looking for a trust worthy, reliable and convenient mechanic definitely book Mike! I am 25 years old and the moment any light comes on in my car I have a panic attack. Mike came to my house within 24 hours to diagnose the service light that appeared to be giving a transmission code. About 36 hours later my car was fixed. I was really worried I would have to replace a component of my transmission but he is a literal expert at CVT engines and assured me that the transmission code I was seeing could mean many things. All and all, his magical hands fixed my baby and it costed A LOT less than what a shop or dealership would have charged me. He is very informative and I would recommend him to everyone and anyone.</p>

            <p>Great and speedy service. Local mechanic. Even offered to pick up my car because I was afraid to drive it. Mike is honest and very fair with his price. The dealer quoted me $900 and he told me $350! I will definitely go back to him for all my other issues.</p>

            <p>Mike is always willing to help in an emergency situation. He does great work at a reasonable price. He walks you through what jobs need to be done and gets it done in a timely manner. He makes getting you car repaired very convenient and affordable!</p>

            <p>Mike came to my house and did a nice job with the requested repair. Price was fair & the car is running much better now.

                Thanks</p>
